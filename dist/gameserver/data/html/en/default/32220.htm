<html><head>Master Selsia:<br>
Welcome. I am Master Selsia of the Kamael Guild here. Frankly, I was somewhat disappointed to be assigned here -- 1 had hoped to goto a larger town where I could interact with more races. But I have learned to be content here. And who knows what the future holds? In any case, how can I help you?<br>
