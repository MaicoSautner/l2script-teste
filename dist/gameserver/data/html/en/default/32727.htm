Puss the Cat:<br>
Meow! Good to see you, meow! I am Puss the Cat! I am a faithful servant of Taoist Daema, Ahuron Raulian meow! My master is Ahuron Raulian - one of the top ten masters in the Ivory Tower.<br>
Recently, my master went on a little excursion with his beloved lady and took care of Bloody Fairy, meow! A few days later, there was a box filled with enormous watermelon seeds in front of my master's lab, meow!<br>
There was Red Fairy dust on the box, so it must be sent from the Bloody Fairy! But the watermelon keeps bugging me to give it nectar, meow! My master thought that it was a gift anyway and it might bring some luck, so the master wanted to give its seeds to whoever was able to obtain the nectar... they could then plant the seeds, and raise the fruit, meow!<br>
Now the Puss brothers, the ones who give seeds to whoever brings them nectar, have started the <font color="LEVEL">Watermelon Event</font>!<br>
