Welcome, traveler! I assume that since you know this place, you probably heard about me from someone.<br>
I'm here to help adventurers secretly to enter the Steel Citadel. If you are already familiar with Steel Citadel, I still can't let you go inside.<br>
It's just too dangerous for the inexperienced. So ... What would you like to do?<br>
