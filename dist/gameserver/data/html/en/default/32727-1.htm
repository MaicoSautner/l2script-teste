Puss the Cat:<br>
All watermelons absorb nectar, meow! <font color="LEVEL">When you double-click the seeds, a watermelon will grow, and when you pour nectar onto it, it will grow faster, meow!</font><br>
If it absorbs enough nectar, the watermelon will get bigger, then it will divide into chunks when hit with a weapon, meow!<br>
But, there are some things to be cautious about, meow!<br>
First, if you hit the watermelon before it fully grows, it will wither from malnutrition, so be careful, meow! Also, your gourd will always want to run away, so make sure you smash it before it is gone! Growing watermelons run away after 3 minutes; and Rotten, Fresh, and Plump watermelons after 1 minute and 30 seconds! Also, you can't smash Honey Watermelons with an ordinary weapon! You can only hit it with the weapon named Crono something, which makes a musical sound when used, meow! Also, it is very hard to smash Honey Watermelons by yourself, so make sure you bring your friends to help you out! Lastly, when you smash the watermelon, you must do it on a flat land! It would be a bad idea to smash them near a roof or cliff, meow!<br>
So?<br>
Do you understand, meow?<br>
