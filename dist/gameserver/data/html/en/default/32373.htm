Welcome! I waited for you for so long... I have to tell you about a strong magical barrier that surrounds the Steel Citadel. If any non-evil will penetrate inside the barrier will be activated, tearing everything will be in this field. Fortunately, I know how to get around this magic. Want I help you?<br>
