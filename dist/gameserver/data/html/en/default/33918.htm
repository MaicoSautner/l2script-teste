Aria Furstmater:<br>
Friends, are you? Trusted allies? You are wise.<br>
If only I had known. Long have I searched for answers, power. Many a powerful foe fell before me, but yet my love remains imprisoned inside a seal, and I am powerless.<br>
What is the purpose of all the knowledge I gathered along the wat? All the wealth, the power? It is all to naught.<br>
Help me. Slay the foul beasts that haunt me, and I will reward you handsomely.<br>
