So you wanna make a dual weapon? You've come to the right place, my friend! We specialize in everything except for A-grade!<br>
We're said to be second only to the legendary <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith of Mammon</font>!<br>
You don't even have to bring me a stamp. Just bring me the swords you want combined and some Adena.<br>
Just bring me the swords you want combined as well as Stones of Purity as a fee.<br>
Make sure the swords are either Superior, Common, or Masterwork.<br>
Each sword must be combined with a sword of its own kind! Superior weapons must be combined with other Superior weapons, and so on. A Masterwork dual weapon can only be made using swords above grade B, which is the lowest grade we work with.<br>
Remember, you can't combine swords you've bestowed with skills and stuff.<br>
Remember as well that an Enchanted weapon loses its effect once it is combined with another.<br>
So, which would you like?<br>
