<font color="LEVEL">Augmenting</font> means giving energy to weapons or accessories.<br>
Augmenting is simple, but it isn't always accurate. Bring me <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stones</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Life Stones</font> and a few other materials and I'll augment accessories and weapons for you.<br>
The Life Stones used for augmentation have strong connections with its owner. The augmented items can only be used by their owners. Also stones above the users' level do not show the effects of augmentation.<br>
Lastly, accessory augmentation requires good materials. So would you like to try?<br>
