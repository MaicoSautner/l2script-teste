Blacksmith Feynn:<br>
I, the great Feynn, am talented at augmenting items as well. Are you requesting something be augmented right now?<br>
Did you hear that Life Stones can no longer be found? The good thing is that a more powerful stone has been found. It's called the <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stone</font>.<br>
Don't worry. You can keep <font color="LEVEL">augmenting</font> if you have <font color="LEVEL">Life Stones</font> left. I can also exchange those <font color="LEVEL">Life Stones</font> for <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stones</font>.<br>
