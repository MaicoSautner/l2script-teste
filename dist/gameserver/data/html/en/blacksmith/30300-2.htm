Blacksmith Pushkin:<br>
The Black Anvil guild has always produced fine craftsmen. I, of course, am one of them. I will augment your item with great care.<br>
Did you hear that <font color="LEVEL">Life Stones can no longer be found</font>? The good thing is that a more powerful stone has been found. It's called the <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stone</font>.<br>
You can keep <font color="LEVEL">augmenting</font> if you have <font color="LEVEL">Life Stones</font> left. I can also exchange those <font color="LEVEL">Life Stones</font> for <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stones</font>.<br>
