Blacksmith Poitan:<br>
Nice to meet you, traveler. Your timing is excellent! I just finished remodeling the workshop yesterday, so you're my first customer this season!<br>
We finished remodeling our workspace and reopened not too long ago. You are lucky! There are quite a few people who had to go back empty-handed. What can I do for you?<br>
