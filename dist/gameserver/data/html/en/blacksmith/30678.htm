Hmph, who are you? Why did you come here? Unless you have a case of Dwarven beer in that tiny saddle bag, I don't want to hear about it! Bahhh!<br>
All I ever hear is heat this, cool that, get to the bellows, it's too hot, don't drop it! Argh! Makes me want to puke! It SO does not pay to be the low man on the totem pole! I want to MAKE something!<br>
Armor, a blade... anything!<br>
