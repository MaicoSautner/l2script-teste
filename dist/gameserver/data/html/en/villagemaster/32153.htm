<html><body>The High Priest of Prana:<br>
God be with you the glory of the great Light ....<br>
Having lived in this world long enough to gain experience, I decided to go down to the village and educate people.<br>
People willing to turn to the true faith can be found in every corner of the world. If they are highly misleading, I feel even more value to their work.<br>
Since I am a representative of humanity, I can not complain. It would be unfair if it is assigned to the case who knows nothing about the world of a young girl.<br>
