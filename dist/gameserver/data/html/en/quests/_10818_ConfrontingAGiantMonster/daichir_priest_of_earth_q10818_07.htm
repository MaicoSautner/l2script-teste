<html><head><body>Head Priest of the Earth Daichir:<br>If you want to achieve true strength, defeat the monsters who threaten the safety of this world. I'll tell you which monsters 
to defeat.<br>You must defeat <font color="LEVEL">Istina, Octavis, and Tauti</font> in an <font color="LEVEL">Epic Battle</font>. 
You must also defeat <font color="LEVEL">Beleth and Earth Wyrm Trasken</font>.<br>However, defeating Earth Wyrm Trasken is difficult. 
That's why I have another method. Would like to hear it?<br>
