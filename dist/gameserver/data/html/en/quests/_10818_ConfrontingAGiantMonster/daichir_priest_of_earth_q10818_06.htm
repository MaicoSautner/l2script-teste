<html><head><body>Head Priest of the Earth Daichir:<br>Defeat the monsters that are threatening the safety of this world. I'll tell you which ones to defeat.
<br>First, you must defeat <font color="LEVEL">Istina, Octavis, and Tauti</font> in an <font color="LEVEL">Epic Battle</font>. 
You must also defeat <font color="LEVEL">Beleth</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Earth Wyrm Trasken</font>, and bring a 
<font color="LEVEL">Dark Soul Stone</font>.<br>However, defeating Earth Wyrm Trasken is difficult. 
That's why I have another method. Would like to hear it?<br>
