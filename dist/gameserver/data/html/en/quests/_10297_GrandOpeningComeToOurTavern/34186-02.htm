The stories we are telling are about the <font color="LEVEL">terrifying monsters that are known throughout the continent</font>.<br>
Stories of the likes of the <font color="LEVEL">Lord of Hellfire</font>, Tauti, <font color="LEVEL">Kelbim of the Atelia Fortress</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">Ice Queen Freya</font> of the Frozen Labyrinth. We'll tell you stories about how they came to be.<br>
We are always coming up with better ways to tell the stories.<br>
