Walter? Hm...
<br>
Actually, I've known about the paper pieces 
in Ye Sagira for quite some time now... 
I just wasn't sure exactly where they were. 
I was looking for them a while back, 
wandering through Exploration Zone 3 with 
Walter, but he kept following me and talking  
me and... well... I ended up losing my temper 
and shouting at him... we haven't spoken since.
<br>
Did he say anything else?
