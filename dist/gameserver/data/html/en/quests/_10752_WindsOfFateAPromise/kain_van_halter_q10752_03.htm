Cayn Van Halter:<br>
So You sent the Queen Arta?<br>
Well. Well, I believe that You are not lying and Gizel really attacked first. You see, vampires are difficult to control yourself...<br>
But what are You doing here? What you're looking for? I don't think Artie interested in vampires like Gizel.<br>
