<html><head><body>Refugee Neti:<br>The ones who attacked Gludin were Orcs and Dark Elves. I mean, they were revolutionaries, really. They are against the Aden kingdom and King Cadmus. They called themselves 
the <font color="LEVEL">Ashen Shadow Revolutionaries</font>.<br>It might be because of the Embryo, but the Kingdom hasn't taken any action. Maybe they think it will be alright since it's happening in Gludin. 
These revolutionaries aren't to be laughed at. It can get really dangerous.<br>
