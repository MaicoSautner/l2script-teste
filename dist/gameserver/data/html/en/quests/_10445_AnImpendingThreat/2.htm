Captain Mathias:<br><br>
Do you have any orc friends? Have you met Kakai, the Lord of Flame? They are all <font color="LEVEL">Noble Orcs</font>, and their opponents are <font color="LEVEL">Orc Supervia</font>. They are the ones who are settled in Gainak.<br>
However, some folks refused to be part of Orc Supervia and left the group. They are called <font color="LEVEL">Nerva Orcs</font>.<br><br>
