<html><head><body>Master Cyphona:<br>We know a way to defeat these spirits, at least temporarily.
I will take care of rewarding you if you carry out this mission. And every time you complete a mission,
I will give you an object that will prove our trust. <br> You can prove the level of trust between us.
The higher the level, the better the reward. In addition, I can give you secret missions.
However, these signs disappear with time, therefore, in order to preserve our trust, you must perform missions from time to time.<br>
