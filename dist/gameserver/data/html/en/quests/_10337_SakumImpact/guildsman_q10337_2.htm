Definitely possible! In any case the most important thing 
a positive attitude.

However, Sakuma need to catch him 
portrait. The other day I managed to get a portrait, but 
only in the profile, and this is not enough. We 
gathered to send the orientation on it, but 
available does not give an accurate portrait 
ideas about his appearance.

Will not you help us?
