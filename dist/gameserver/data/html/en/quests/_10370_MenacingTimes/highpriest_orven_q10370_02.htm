<html><head><body>High Priest Orven:<br>As you already know Shilen sent several of her creatures to destroy Aden Castle. With your 
elp, you and the Aden Vanguard were able to stop this attack. Now our soldiers can come home and focus on protecting Aden.
<br>But there is some troubling news from the Aden Vanguard. I know you have done more than enough for the town of Aden, but 
would you care to possibly lend us your strength once more?<br>
