As you already know Shilen sent several of her 
creatures to destroy Aden Castle. With your help, 
you and the Aden Vanguard were able to stop 
this attack. Now our soldiers can come home and 
focus on protecting Aden.
<br>
Although this has been victory, news from Aden 
Vanguard has me concerned. As much as I 
would like attend to these matters personally, 
I have work here that must be complete. Do you 
think you can help me?
