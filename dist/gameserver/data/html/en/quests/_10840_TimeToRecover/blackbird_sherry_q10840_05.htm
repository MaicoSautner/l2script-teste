<html><head><body>Blackbird Clan Member Sherry:<br>A problem? Well, it might not be a problem really. I was captured by the Embryo, and was saved by the Aden Vanguard member, Eliyah. 
<br>After I was recued, I've been trying to carry out Leona's mission. But it's been hard since the Embryo are getting stronger by the day. I haven't been able to recover fully.<br>
