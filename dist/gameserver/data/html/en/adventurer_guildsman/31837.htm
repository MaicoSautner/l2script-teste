Adventure Guildsman:<br>
You can hear about all kinds of adventures at the Adventure Guild.<br>
An adventure can be something as trivial as delivering a letter or playing matchmaker, or be as grand as joining an expedition to fight Earth Dragon Antharas!<br>
I can also help you exchange your <font color="LEVEL">Adventurer's Marks and Seals</font>.<br>
Now tell me, what is your desire?<br>
